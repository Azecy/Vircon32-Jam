# Vircon32-Jam
An unfinished game made for the first Vircon32 Jam.

The game can be downloaded at: https://azecy.itch.io/vircon32-jam

This game uses my own implementation of the ECS programming pattern, but most likely, it does not function well. I am still learning how to make ECS code that is cache-friendly, and it is missing many other potential optimizations.

The background music is "Law in the City" by Alexandr Zhelanov (https://soundcloud.com/alexandr-zhelanov) but is not included in this repository to avoid licensing issues. The project will not compile without a .wav with the correct name in a "bgm" subfolder.
